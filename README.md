# Rock-Paper-Scissors

This Rock-Paper-Scissors Game is an interactive web-based game where players face off against the computer.
This project utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to guarantee a fun development experience and visually appealing results. 

# Features
User-Friendly Interface ðŸŽ¨ Everything is visually fun and exciting thanks to the bright gradient background.
A container that is well structured, with rounded edges, a subtle shadow to add depth, and padding to make the page look neat.
Images are styled to provide hover effects, making everything feel more alive when the user interacts with the webpage. 

# Game Logic
ðŸ¤– The user chooses Rock, Paper, or Scissors by clicking an image. The computer que randomly chooses as well. 
Once both the user and the computer have chosen Rock, Paper, or Scissors, both choices follow standard outcomes: Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beat Paper, Paper beats Rock, And based on those results, the outcome is displayed to the user. 

# Dynamic Feedback 
ðŸ’¬ Each round has a randomized outcome message that is unique to that round! The messages for wins and losses for the user will vary for better user engagement. How to Play: 
1. Click on Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
2. The computer will automatically select a choice.
3. The game will display who wins and show a fun message.
4. Repeat as often as you like! This project is a great way to practice JavaScript event handling, DOM manipulation, and light game logic.
